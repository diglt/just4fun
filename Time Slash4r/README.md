Hello there! This is a silly project i created, mainly for my own use, which acts like the windows search bar but for certain directories that i use often.

It's not really intended to be used in the state uploaded here, rather it's for you to take and tweak to ur liking to include ur own directories and whatever.

Use it, look at it whatever i don't mind at all.

Here's how the setup works:
1. Download "TimeSlash4r.py"
2. Open TimeSlash4r and edit where i have made "comments" to tell YOU to put ur own directory paths.
3. Save TimeSlash4r.py
4. Put TimeSlash4r.py in any location u choose
5. Download TimeSlash4r.bat
6. Edit TimeSlash4r.bat to remove the words after "cd = " and put the location u saved TimeSlash4r.py before
7. Save TimeSlash4r.bat
8. Place TimeSlash4r.bat on ur desktop (OPTIONAL)
9. Finally, run TimeSlash4r.bat
